# 13.py

## Find where 13 resides within a range of numbers.

This function is designed to force the user to select two numbers in order to find out where 13 exists between them. The program only completes upon the user entering 2 numbers that fulfill two conditions. The first condition is that the first number is lower than the second number, and the second condition is that the first number is less than or equal to 13, and the second number is greater than 13. 

# contains_sh.py

## Discover whether the string "sh" exists within a word or phrase.

This function prompts the user to enter a word or phrase in order to find out if the string "sh" exists within it, and where it exists. The user is no longer forced to continuously enter values until one that satisfies the prompt is entered. The user now has the option to continue to the function or end it through entering either "yes" or any other entry.
